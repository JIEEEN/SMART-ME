SMART-ME is an application that would help users become familiar with IT devices themselves, beyond the concept of providing assistance only when needed. It provides tutorials of the basic smartphone applications such as call, message, and camera so that the users can learn how to use each application. The main point of our solution is that our application not only teaches how to use it but also enables users to experience and learn the mechanism. Our solution allows users to understand the UI easily by constructing a virtual screen and displaying explanation dialogues on it. The app aims to help users learn how to use it in real-world problem situations and confirm their understanding of complex functions.
